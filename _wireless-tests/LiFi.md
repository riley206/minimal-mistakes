# Testing LiFi Technology for Wireless Communication

LiFi (Light Fidelity) is a cutting-edge technology that enables wireless communication using light waves. In this post, we will walk through a basic setup and testing procedure for a LiFi network to evaluate its performance in a real-world environment.

## What You Need for LiFi Testing

To perform the LiFi test, ensure you have the following equipment:

- **LiFi Transmitter**: A device that transmits data using light.
- **LiFi Receiver**: A device that receives data via light signals.
- **LiFi-Enabled Router**: A router that supports LiFi communication.
- **Light Source**: An LED light bulb, which will transmit the LiFi signal.
- **Test Laptop or Mobile Device**: A device to receive and test the data transmission.

## Step 1: Set Up the LiFi Transmitter

Start by setting up the **LiFi Transmitter**. Connect the transmitter to your router or access point that will provide the data to be transmitted via light.

1. **Connect the transmitter** to the router using an Ethernet cable.
2. **Position the transmitter** near a light source (like an LED bulb) to ensure clear light transmission to the receiver.

**Example Setup Command** (depending on the LiFi device):
```bash
sudo lifi-setup --transmitter --ip 192.168.0.100 --router 192.168.0.1
```
