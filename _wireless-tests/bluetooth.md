# Bluetooth Encryption Test

## Overview
This test is designed to verify whether a Bluetooth connection supports encryption. It simulates a connection between a device and a Bluetooth peripheral and checks if the communication channel is encrypted to ensure the security of transmitted data.

## Test Procedure

1. **Initialize Bluetooth Connection:**
   - Establish a Bluetooth connection between the testing device and a paired Bluetooth peripheral.
   - Ensure that the peripheral supports encryption (e.g., headphones, speakers, or smart devices).

2. **Send Unencrypted Data:**
   - Attempt to transmit a small packet of data (e.g., `"Test Message 1"`) without enabling encryption.
   - Record the response from the peripheral.

3. **Enable Encryption:**
   - Activate Bluetooth encryption.
   - Confirm that encryption is enabled by querying the connection's security settings.

4. **Send Encrypted Data:**
   - Transmit a second packet of data (e.g., `"Encrypted Test Message"`) after enabling encryption.
   - Check if the data is securely transmitted and confirm if the peripheral acknowledges the encrypted message.

5. **Compare Results:**
   - If the data transmission before encryption succeeds but the encrypted transmission fails, the peripheral does not support encryption.
   - If both transmissions succeed, verify that encryption was indeed enabled during the second transmission.

## Expected Results

- **Encryption Supported:**
   - The device and peripheral successfully transmit data while encryption is enabled.
   - The security level of the connection shows encryption as active.

- **Encryption Not Supported:**
   - The device fails to transmit encrypted data, or the encryption feature is not available on the peripheral.
   - The connection security level indicates no encryption.

## Example Code (Python Simulation)

```python
import bluetooth

def test_bluetooth_encryption():
    # Simulated Bluetooth device address
    device_address = "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
    
    # Step 1: Establish Bluetooth connection
    socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    socket.connect((device_address, 1))
    
    # Step 2: Send unencrypted data
    socket.send("Test Message 1")
    print("Sent unencrypted data")

    # Step 3: Enable encryption (simulated function call)
    if enable_encryption(socket):
        print("Encryption enabled")
    else:
        print("Encryption failed or not supported")

    # Step 4: Send encrypted data
    socket.send("Encrypted Test Message")
    print("Sent encrypted data")

    # Close connection
    socket.close()

def enable_encryption(socket):
    # Simulate enabling encryption, return True if supported
    # In a real implementation, use a library function to check encryption status
    return True
```
# Run the test
```bash
test_bluetooth_encryption()
```
