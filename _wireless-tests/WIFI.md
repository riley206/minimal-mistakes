# Test One Content

In this test, we will walk through a comprehensive set of steps for troubleshooting common wireless network issues. This process is divided into different sections, each designed to diagnose a specific problem that users might encounter when trying to connect to a wireless network.

## Step 1: Check Physical Connections and Wireless Settings

Before diving into deeper technical troubleshooting, it's essential to verify that all physical connections and basic wireless settings are correctly configured.

### 1.1 Verify Router Power and Status

Ensure that your wireless router is powered on and the status lights indicate it's functioning correctly. Most routers have indicator lights for power, internet connection, and Wi-Fi.

**What to check:**
- Power light should be solid green or blue.
- Wi-Fi light should be blinking or solid, indicating active transmission.
- Internet/Online light should be lit to indicate connectivity.

### 1.2 Verify Device Wi-Fi is Enabled

Ensure that the Wi-Fi adapter on your device is enabled. Sometimes, laptops have physical switches to turn Wi-Fi on or off, while other devices require enabling the adapter via software.

**Command for Linux-based systems:**

```bash
nmcli radio wifi
```
